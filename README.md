## ðŸ“ƒ Project Description

This is a Rental A Car Application where people can book cars or providing their cars for booking. There are two user roles - dealers and renters. 
The renters are these who are able to rent the cars and the dealers are these who providing the cars.The app is built in order to help the both users - 
dealers and renters to do CRUD operations related to cars and bookings. The applicatication has a public part(accessible without authentication).
This is the home page and the catalog, as well as the details for a certain car and the forms for register and login. The application has also a private part
(available for registered users only). When the user is logged in as a dealer, he can see the cars which were added by himself, he can edit or delete them or 
he can add a new car. The user who is logged in as a renter can see his own bookings, he can cancel a reservation only if the date is after today and also he can book a car.
The renter also has an option to rate a certain car on the details page of each car. The both users have an option to go and see his own profile and edit the information about themselves.
